# WCN3
3rd Workshop in Computational Neuroscience

## Brian
I use brian2, [The Brian spiking neural network simulator](http://briansimulator.org/) version 2.


### Prerequisites
Before attending the workshop, make sure that:
* You have [Python3](https://www.python.org/) on your machines. I use the one that comes with [Debian](https://www.debian.org/). 
[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) also has it ready to install. 
If you use windows, you can use [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda).
* You can program in Python3. 
If not please learn it, there are many free online tutorials, books and courses, 
like [The official tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/), 
[Python for non-programmers](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers)
and [Python form programmers](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers). 
* You have [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), 
[scipy](https://www.scipy.org/), 
[pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) and 
[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) installed. 
* It is good to have [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/). 


### Install
In linux terminal run this:

```bash
$ sudo pip3 install --upgrade brian2
```

For other cases, read the [manual](http://brian2.readthedocs.org/en/latest/introduction/install.html).
It downloads and installs Brian2 and all its dependencies.
